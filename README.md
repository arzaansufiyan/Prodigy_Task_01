PRODIGY_CS_01
A python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text messages. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Usage
Encrypting a Message:

Choose the option to encrypt.
Enter the message you want to encrypt.
Enter the shift value (a positive integer) to shift the letters.
The program will output the encrypted message.
Decrypting a Message:

Choose the option to decrypt.
Enter the encrypted message.
Enter the shift value (the same value used for encryption).
The program will output the decrypted message.
Running the Program
To run the program:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Open the Python file (caesar_cipher.py) in your preferred Python environment.
Follow the instructions provided in the console to encrypt or decrypt messages.
Limitations
The program only supports English alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and ignores other characters such as numbers and symbols.
The shift value can be any positive integer.
Feel free to contribute and improve the program!
